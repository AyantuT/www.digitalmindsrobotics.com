  FRC Team 5458 Digital Minds is a FIRST Robotics team founded on August 26, 2014 when the Davis High Schoolâ€™s FIRST Robotics team, 
  1678 Citrus Circuits introduced their passion for robotics to the Woodland High School and Pioneer High School students. Our goal is to provide students with 
  hands-on experience in STEM and serve as a productive learning environment that fosters collaborative skills in engineering and management.
